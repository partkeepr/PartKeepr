# Reporting Bugs

Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/partkeepr/PartKeepr) for bugs and feature requests. Please do NOT post usage or installation questions there, it is not a forum!

Guidelines:

 * Create __one issue per bug or feature request__
 * __Do not mix__ multiple bugs or feature requests into a single issue
 * __Search the issue tracker__ if the issue has already been reported
 * Ensure you are running the latest version of PartKeepr
 * Try to reproduce the problem on [demo.partkeepr.org](demo.partkeepr.org) prior reporting the issue and indicate in the issue that you have done so
 * Report your __browser type and version__, any __JavaScript errors in the console__ and any other details like __server operating system__, __php version__, __SQL Server type and version__ etc.


Use the dedicated mailing list or IRC for general questions as described on the [PartKeepr Support Page](https://www.partkeepr.org/support/).

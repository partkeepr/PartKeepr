The project is in a pre-alpha state. It's more a sketch or a draft than a
working product. Most of the documentation is missing, same goes for unit tests
and code coverage.



Prequisites:
------------
* PHP 5.3 or higher
* PDO
* SOAP
* Tokenizer Support
* A working PEAR installation

Get the git submodules
----------------------

git submodule update


Install the required PEAR packages:
-----------------------------------

pear config-set auto_discover 1
pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
pear install phpunit/PHPUnit
pear channel-discover pear.phing.info
pear install phing/phing

pear install pear.doctrine-project.org/DoctrineORM
pear install pear.symfony-project.com/YAML


Install the (not yet) optional PEAR packages:
---------------------------------------------

NOTE: THESE PACKAGES ARE REQUIRED IN THE CURRENT BUILDS! INSTALL THEM!

//These packages are required if you wish to build the test suite. I know,
//it's quite a big list, but they are required for development. If you
//only wish to use the product, you can safely skip them.

pear channel-discover components.ez.no
pear install phpunit/phpcpd
pear channel-discover pear.phpmd.org
pear channel-discover pear.pdepend.org
pear install --alldeps phpmd/PHP_PMD-alpha
pear install PhpDocumentor


Install optional binaries:
--------------------------
If you wish to build the complete test suite, you need additional software:

jslint from http://www.javascriptlint.com/


Verify if everything is setup correctly:
----------------------------------------
cd <installation path>
phing test-setup


Install the database and test data
----------------------------------

Create a database on your database server. Right now, we support MySQL (preferred) and PostgreSQL (minor problems).
You can also try SQLite3, Oracle and MSSQL - but it's not guaranteed that it works.

Setup the database using the SetupDatabase.php script in the "testing" folder. The SetupDatabase.php script has a help,
you can see it by using php testing/SetupDatabase.php --help

Command line is important because you need to enter "YES" to confirm
the operation.


Building the frontend
---------------------

Type:

phing build

Then wait a minute or so, after everything is completed successfully
(remember that 777 on the whole project might be a good idea until the final
path layout has been stabilized).

You can then fire up your browser and point it to the frontend/ directory. Note
that you need chrome/chromium with console.log support OR Firefox with the
firebug extension. Otherwise, your browser complains about the missing
console.log function. These console.log statements are necessary for debugging
and development.

If you make changes to any file in the src/frontend/ directory, you need to
re-build the project. To speed up things, you can use "phing build.quick" to
skip most files you usually don't change - everything in 3rdparty and
the huge image directories.

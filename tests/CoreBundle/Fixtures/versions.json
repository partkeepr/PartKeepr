    "releasedate": "2012-11-05 17:10:32",
    "changelog": "GUI Changes:\r\n\r\n* The Part Filter Panel now lets you filter by distributor and manufacturer \r\n* You can now remove the filter criteria for storage location, distributor and manufacturer directly now; previously, you had to click \"Reset\" to remove an active storage location filter \r\n* You can filter by the part create date\r\n* You can filter for all parts where no stock removals have taken place; this is useful to find parts you have never used and which you might remove from your inventory \r\n* The part filter columns now wrap to aid with smaller display sizes \r\n* A new part picker has been implemented, which has basically the same features as the regular grid, including the part filter panel. \r\n* The \"Create from Template\" button is now called \"Duplicate\" and supports duplicating of all part properties, including parameters, manufacturers, distributors and attachments. \r\n* The upload dialog now explains where the upload limit comes from and how to configure PHP to allow bigger uploads \r\n* Previously, you had to calculate the price per item manually if you had a package with, say, 100 items and only know the package price. PartKeepr now does that automatically; you can either fill in the price per item or the package price, and PartKeepr will calculate the other value for you. \r\n* In addition to the default layout, we also support a compact layout of the Part Manager which is helpful for small screens, like laptops.\r\n\r\nTechnical Changes: \r\n* Several queries have been optimized, so that the parts grid should load now much faster on slower systems \r\n* PartKeepr supports now xcache and memcache and you can now configure them. By default, APC is used (if available). \r\n* The frontend now supports individual JS files, instead of a large JS file. This is useful for debugging and can be enabled with the following configuration: Configuration::setOption(\"partkeepr.frontend.debug_all\", true); \r\n* Previously, we've used the bundled jsb3 builder from Sencha. However, that tool was using jsdb, a non-crossplatform binary chunk, which is now replaced with a generic minifier implementation, which uses either jsmin or optionally yui-compressor."

PartKeepr is an [inventory management software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory_management_software), primarily
designed for electronic components.

PartKeepr is written in **PHP** and using the [**Symfony2**](http://symfony.com) framework.

Demo Sites
----------

To test everything which has been written so far, there are two demo pages prepared.

The latest release from github is available at http://demo.partkeepr.org.
The most up-to-date version of the GitHub `master` branch is published at https://demo-git.partkeepr.org.
Both demo pages are built from the git sources and reset to a demo state once an hour.

Requirements
------------

PartKeepr needs:

* PHP between 7.0 and 7.1 - migration to newer symfony is needed before we support current php 7.x
* A MySQL or PostgreSQL database

Installation
------------

Please read our [setup guide](documentation/Installation.md)

Thanks
------

A very big "thank you" goes out to Georgyo of NYC resistor - although he claimed that he isn't creative, he invented the
name "PartKeepr" which eventually became the project's name.
